## autoc.el

An Emacs minor mode that provides terse and flexible in-file code generation.

The mode is implemented
in
[autoc-core.org](https://github.com/rmhsilva/autoc.el/blob/master/autoc-core.org),
in the "literate programming" style - read it!

**WARNING** this minor mode is a security concern. It reads and evaluates
arbitrary elisp code in potentially *any* file. You've been warned.
